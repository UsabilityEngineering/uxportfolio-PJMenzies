My name is Peter Menzies. I'm a computer science student. I've done two internships with the video software company Telestream. I plan on working with them when I graduate. I'm interested in this class because of graphic design background and in my internships at Telestream I developed internal tools and the design of these were extremely important for the end users in the company.
